# EF Manchester - Earth Month Project ♻️

This task of choosing a monument to build from recycled materials was given to all classes as April housed the Earth Day celebrations.

For this project, my classmates and I chose **Kukulcán's Pyramid** - one of the [New Seven Wonders of the World](https://www.britannica.com/list/new-seven-wonders-of-the-world).

## Overview

We're using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as the package manager.

### Development Server

To start up the development server, it's necessary to install the dependencies first (if you haven't installed it yet).

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

### Build and Production Server

To start up the production server, it is first required to build the project with the following command:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

After the build process is complete, run the production server:

```sh
pnpm run start
```

## Stack

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as the [React](https://react.dev) Framework with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as the CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) framework.

As this project was a simple and small one, we decided to write it with JavaScript.

## Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimise and load **Inter**, a custom Google Font.
